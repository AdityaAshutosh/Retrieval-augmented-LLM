Extending Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to Multimodal Documents














Monday, July 29 12:00–2:00 p.m. MT














Semantic retrieval has become a common tool for helping to drive large language models toward data-grounded reasoning. However, naive techniques start to break down when non-textual inputs come into the picture. Instead of ignoring non-textual information, we’ll tackle multimodal document ingestion and retrieval. 

Construct the simple retrieval-augmented generation pipeline for context enrichment. 
Consider approaches for reasoning with images to help an LLM-powered agent converse about image-dense research papers.

Orchestrating a Multimodal Agent With Foundation Model Building Blocks














Tuesday, July 30 9:00–11:00 a.m. MT














As AI continues to make its way into popular use, deep learning components from a wide range of disciplines are quickly getting incorporated into end-user applications, and emerging workflows that combine multiple seemingly disjoint models or input types are able to operate surprisingly well. 

Investigate the primitives that help to make up anything from MNIST image generators to vision-guided language models. 
Discuss large model orchestration and show how they can be used to construct end-to-end multimodal agent systems.
