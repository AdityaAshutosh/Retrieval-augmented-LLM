Name: Peng Jia
Title: Associate Professor. College of Physics and Optoelectronics
Location: Taiyuan University of Technology, China
Associated universities: Taiyuan University of Technology
LinkedIn profile: Peng Jia



















Peng Jia is an associate professor in the College of Physics and Optoelectronics, Taiyuan University of Technology since 2018. His main interests are Smart Astronomical Instruments and Data Processing Methods, which include digital twins of optical telescopes, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and citizen science. He has published over 70 academic papers and has over10 patents in digital twin of optics systems and data processing methods. He has received several awards including the Science and Technology Progress Award of Shanxi Province (second prize), the Talent of Shanxi Province and the Excellence of Young Astronomer in the Information working committee, Chinese Astronomical Society.  
How did you learn about The Deep Learning Institute (DLI)?  
I was first introduced to NVIDIA in 2016 through the NVIDIA CUDA Research Centre Program (https://www.dur.ac.uk/arc/nvidiacuda/), when I was studying simulation of optics system at Durham University. In 2018, I returned to the Department of Instrumentation, Taiyuan University of Technology, China and carried out independent research and teaching in digital twin of optic systems and machine learning algorithms. However, I found it difficult to find reliable and enough computing resources to support my work. I then learned about educator resources available from DLI and applied to become a University Ambassador, teaching deep learning and computer vision. Using the resources and material provided by DLI, I have trained over 600 students.  
How does DLI enhance your other work? 
In 2022, a new Intelligent Sensing Engineering degree was founded, and several lessons are designed based on the teaching kits and DLI workshops. Currently, my group is developing citizen science projects and teaching material for astronomy data processing methods with machine learning algorithms using the resources provided by DLI.  The teaching resources are designed with industry background and at an academic level, which provides me with insights to better design frameworks for different applications, such as data processing pipelines for data obtained by different telescopes. 



















































Name: Manuel Ujaldon Martinez 
Title: Full Professor en Universidad de Málaga
Location: Universidad de Malaga, Spain 
Associated universities: University of Malaga
LinkedIn profile: Manuel Ujaldon Martinez



















Manuel Ujaldon is full professor of computer architecture at the University of Malaga (Spain). His main research interests are high-performance and low-power GPGPU computing for image processing, biomedical applications and evolutionary computation. Prof. Ujaldon was a predoctoral and postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Science Dept. of the University of Maryland, visiting researcher at Biomedical Informatics Dept. of the Ohio State University (USA, 2003-08) and conjoint senior lecturer at the University of Newcastle (Australia, 2012-15).  He has published 8 books on computer architecture and around 100 papers in international peer-reviewed journals and conferences. Manuel was awarded CUDA Fellow by Nvidia in 2012, having taught since then more than 150 activities related to GPU computing in 23 countries, including more than 70 invited talks and tutorials in ACM/IEEE conferences.
How did you first hear about the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI)?  
As part of the CUDA Fellow group selected by NVIDIA in 2012, I was already engaged as an NVIDIA instructor for several years before DLI was created.  
How does DLI contribute to your career in academia?
I find the role of DLI Ambassador to be very rewarding. I have been invited to teach in prominent universities and talk at prestigious conferences around the world which has enabled me to engage with excellent students and colleagues of all backgrounds. For a cosmopolitan and enthusiastic instructor like me, it exposes me to diverse cultures and communities, permitting me to discover fascinating countries and expand my teaching skills in many ways. Every DLI workshop that I organize is different, challenging and refreshing my professional career. This is a job that is hard to get tired of!    
Tell us about the DLI workshops you have delivered outside of Spain.
I have had many opportunities to teach abroad as an ambassador, mainly because of my reputation as an experienced NVIDIA instructor. Since 2012, I’ve taught over 100 CUDA workshops and tutorials in   ACM/IEEE conferences worldwide. Colleagues continue to invite me to participate in these activities since accelerated computing has become such a hot topic in the world of HPC. With DLI, we have much better infrastructure to run tutorials and labs, which make the workshops much more effective for our students. The University of Malaga has a long tradition of having a proactive student exchange program. Some of these programs include exchanging teaching experiences. From this, I have been very fortunate to be able to visit prominent universities in Africa and one in Asia over the last couple of years:

Namibia University of Science and Technology (Namibia - October, 2021).
Durban University of Technology (South Africa - July, 2022).
University of Cape Town (#1 University in Africa - August, 2022).
University of Kathmandu (Nepal - November, 2021).  

In all these experiences, I’ve found students to be fascinated by the topics, receptive to the training and excited to receive NVIDIA Certificates of competency by an internationally experienced instructor. Overall, people were very grateful with my efforts and the hospitality was outstanding during my travels, enabling me to accumulate personal experiences like no other journey has done.
Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with DLI?
I would like to emphasize the utility of teaching kits as a time-saving tool for preparing classes, optimizing the teaching effort and maximizing engagement from students, who look at Nvidia as the reliable source for preparing them to face the challenge of being hired in high-tech companies. Cloud services in AWS are also a fantastic resource for student to execute their first codes right away, without suffering from installing hardware and setting up software, drivers, middleware, libraries, etc.

Certification Process 










What’s the process to get certified by NVIDIA?

Choose the NVIDIA certification exam.  Depending on your job role, expertise, and career aspirations, choose the certification that best suits your needs. Visit the certification center to explore your options.
  
    
   
Prepare with recommended training and learning resources. NVIDIA offers a multitude of free and paid learning resources. For each certification exam, we ‘ve identified a set of training and other resources to help you prepare for the exam. This might include self-paced labs, instructor-led training, whitepapers, blogs, on-demand videos, and more.
  
    
   
Gain hands-on experience. Some of our professional certifications require a level of practical knowledge. Hands-on experience with NVIDIA technologies will better prepare you for these exams.
  
    
   
Schedule and pay for the exam. Once you’re ready, schedule the exam and pay the examination fee. You can do this in the certification center.
  
    
   
Take the exam.













Exam Registration, Costs, and Cancellation Policy  














How do I register for an exam? You can register in our certification center.
How should I prepare for an exam? Each certification exam has a list of recommended training and additional materials to review.
How long is the exam, and what types of questions can I expect? The number of questions on a certification exam varies by exam and is subject to change as we update it to align it with any changes in the technology and job role. Most of our certification exams contain between 40 and 60 questions. See individual exam webpages in the certification center for details.
How much do exams cost? Exam prices vary and are subject to change. Visit the individual exam webpages for the latest information. In some countries and regions, additional taxes may apply. Contact us here for information on educational and group discounts.  
Can I take a break during my exam? Breaks aren’t allowed for remotely proctored exams. For on-site exams, breaks are permitted. However, the test timer will not stop for the break. 
What’s my window for scheduling an exam? You can schedule certification exams up to 30 days in advance.
How many exams can I have scheduled simultaneously? You can purchase and schedule as many exams as you’d like but you can only take one exam per sitting.
What’s your cancellation policy? Exams are non-cancellable and non-refundable. NVIDIA won’t issue refunds for exams that are missed. You may reschedule an examination date only once. The rescheduled examination date must be within three months of the date the examination fee was paid for that examination. The new date may not occur during the last three days of that three-month period.
















Exam Security and Administration










NVIDIA is committed to ensuring that our certification exams are respected and valued in the marketplace. Accordingly, we make sure the integrity of our exams isn’t compromised and hold our NVIDIA Authorized Testing Partners (NATPs) accountable for taking appropriate steps to prevent and detect fraud and exam security breaches. We conduct periodic data forensics to identify patterns of aberrance in exam results that help detect cheating or content theft. For example, forensic indicators such as types of responses, latency, pass rates, and retakes may reveal patterns of cheating, collusion, or theft. Prevention and early detection are critical elements that require the close cooperation of NATPs. Therefore, in addition to relying on our NATPs to provide industry-standard monitoring during testing, we require them to ensure appropriate physical or virtual testing environments and train administrators and proctors to provide quality oversight. Administrators and proctors who observe violations of testing rules, or suspect a security breach, will immediately contact NVIDIA.
What is an appropriate physical or virtual testing environment? For in-person testing, NVIDIA Authorized Testing Partners (NATPs) will confirm that their testing area is a professional environment where you can take the exam without interruptions and each exam can be proctored with an unobstructed view of every test candidate in the testing area.  For remote testing, the NATP will take test-takers through the exam launch, login procedures, multi-factor identity verification, and a 360° environment security assessment.
What are acceptable methods of proctoring?

Camera/video display: The proctor may remotely monitor you via a camera with a complete view of your testing environment. 
Observation window: The proctor may monitor you through an observation window with a complete view of the testing environment. 
In-room proctoring: The proctor is in the same room as the test-taker.   













Exam Check-In and Procedures











The NVIDIA Authorized Training Partner (NATP) will verify your identity with at least one form of valid government-issued ID (containing both your photograph and signature). The name on your ID must match the name you have registered with.  
The NATP/proctor will not allow recording or electronic devices in the testing area. Such devices include wristwatches, cameras, computers, and cell phones. Additional property, such as books or bags, must be stored outside the testing environment or be inaccessible during the exam. 
The NATP/proctor may permit you to take a break during in-person testing if requested, but the testing clock can’t be stopped during the break. You aren’t permitted to conduct activities during a break that may compromise exam security, including using a telephone and/or communicating with other test candidates. Breaks aren’t permitted for remotely proctored exams. 
The proctor will confirm that your ID matches the NVIDIA account information on the “Proctor Validation Screen” before launching the exam. 
Proctors may answer questions regarding the functionality of the exam software but may not answer questions or provide instructions related to exam content. 

Cheating If a test candidate is caught cheating, the proctor will stop the exam immediately and notify the candidate of the infraction and what was observed.












Online Remote Exams










If you choose to take an exam online remotely, you’ll need to install a secure browser on your computer provided by the NVIDIA Authorized Training Partner (NATP) so that the proctor can communicate with you, monitor and record your examination session, and ensure that you’re not able to use your computer, other devices, or materials to violate the examination rules.
This will involve monitoring you and your computer in real time throughout the examination session, including recording your face, desk, workspace, and voice for security and integrity purposes. You’ll be monitored and recorded at your location by video, audio, and other technological means so that all activity at your location will be visible to the proctor.
The NATP will process your personal data, including personal details provided (such as name and email address), qualifications, education, assessment details, and any data captured during the exam session (identification, monitoring data, answers to exam questions, results of the exam, and records of technical support). At the end of the exam (following final review and confirmed submission), you must disconnect from the NATP’s browser to stop the recording.
In the event any misconduct is detected during the exam session, the examination may be paused or terminated without refund and a report will be provided to NVIDIA. The NATP will share the results of your exam, including personal data, with NVIDIA.
 












Exam Scoring










When will I get my exam results and certification? For most exams, you’ll be informed of your results within minutes. It can take up to 24 hours for results to be communicated to you via email.
How are exams scored? NVIDIA certification exams are pass/fail. You won’t receive a score.
 
























Sharing Your Credentials










NVIDIA certifications serve as tangible evidence of your expertise, proficiency, and commitment to continuous learning. Once received, be sure to share your credentials on your LinkedIn profile and career-related social media posts or by adding a personalized link in your email signature. 
For LinkedIn, follow these step-by-step instructions to add your credential to the "Licenses and Certifications" section of your profile.  Digital certificates can also be downloaded and printed for your records. 












Retaking Exams 










If you don’t pass an exam on the first attempt, you can purchase the exam again. There’s a 72-hour waiting period before the exam can be retaken.
If you don’t pass on the second attempt, you must wait at least 10 days before retaking the exam a third time.
A 14-day waiting period is imposed for the fourth and subsequent exam retakes. 
You may not take any given exam more than five times per year (12 months). This 12-month period starts the day of the purchase of the first exam. 
To take a given exam more than five times per year or to have the time between attempts waived, you must submit a request and obtain prior permission from NVIDIA. Requests should be sent via our contact us form.
These requests should include the following information:

Your name
Your email address
Exam name
Reason(s) why more than five attempts for an exam is needed













Certification Renewal










Can NVIDIA certifications be renewed? NVIDIA certifications are valid for two years, after which you must retake the exam to be recertified.  What do I do when my certification expires? If your certification expires, you must pass the exam again to be recertified. 












Exam Accommodations 










Am I required to take an exam in English? NVIDIA certification exams are currently only available in English. If English isn’t your native language, you can request an accommodation for additional time. Approval for extra time is provided on a case-by-case basis and must be requested before the exam. Send your accommodation requests via our contact us form.
Please include: 

Your name
Your email address
Exam name
Accommodations required


  

What disability accommodations are available? Contact us to request disability accommodation. Please include: 

Your name
Your email address
Exam name
Accommodations required and why













Exam Feedback










How can I provide feedback about an exam question or exam experience? If you have feedback about an NVIDIA training course, provide it directly to the instructor or via the end-of-course survey. If you have feedback on the exam itself or the exam experience, please contact us.












Accuracy and Integrity of Exam Process










Following completion of your exam, NVIDIA and/or the NVIDIA Authorized Training Partner (NATP) may review your exam record for scoring accuracy, for evidence of misconduct, and for response patterns that may suggest your scores don’t represent a valid measure of your knowledge or competence as sampled by the exam (“measurement error”). NVIDIA reserves the right to invalidate your exam if the review of your exam record reveals scoring inaccuracies (attributable to NVIDIA or to the NATP), response patterns indicative of misconduct on your part, or response patterns indicative of measurement error(s). If NVIDIA determines that your exam is invalid due to scoring errors or measurement error(s), you’ll be advised of options for retaking the exam. If NVIDIA determines that your exam is invalid due to misconduct on your part, NVIDIA reserves the right to invalidate your exam and consider your actions in violation of this agreement.












Action for Noncompliance










You understand and agree that if, for any reason and at our sole discretion, NVIDIA believes your exam results do not accurately reflect your true knowledge or mastery of the exam’s subject matter and/or that you’ve violated this agreement, we have the right (without refund of any kind) to deny you any further participation in the exam, cancel a passed exam result, revoke any preexisting NVIDIA certificates, badges, and/or other rights previously conferred on you, and permanently bar you from any further participation in the certification program.
