Warning
LATEST RELEASE
You are currently on the main branch which tracks under-development progress towards the next release.
The current release is version 2.47.0 and corresponds to the 24.06 container release on NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC).

Triton Inference Server is an open source inference serving software that
streamlines AI inferencing. Triton enables teams to deploy any AI model from
multiple deep learning and machine learning frameworks, including TensorRT,
TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, OpenVINO, Python, RAPIDS FIL, and more. Triton
Inference Server supports inference across cloud, data center, edge and embedded
devices on NVIDIA GPUs, x86 and ARM CPU, or AWS Inferentia. Triton Inference
Server delivers optimized performance for many query types, including real time,
batched, ensembles and audio/video streaming. Triton inference Server is part of
NVIDIA AI Enterprise,
a software platform that accelerates the data science pipeline and streamlines
the development and deployment of production AI.
Major features include:

Supports multiple deep learning
frameworks
Supports multiple machine learning
frameworks
Concurrent model
execution
Dynamic batching
Sequence batching and
implicit state management
for stateful models
Provides Backend API that
allows adding custom backends and pre/post processing operations
Supports writing custom backends in python, a.k.a.
Python-based backends.
Model pipelines using
Ensembling or Business
Logic Scripting
(BLS)
HTTP/REST and GRPC inference
protocols based on the community
developed KServe
protocol
A C API and
Java API
allow Triton to link directly into your application for edge and other in-process use cases
Metrics indicating GPU utilization, server
throughput, server latency, and more

New to Triton Inference Server? Make use of
these tutorials
to begin your Triton journey!
Join the Triton and TensorRT community and
stay current on the latest product updates, bug fixes, content, best practices,
and more.  Need enterprise support?  NVIDIA global support is available for Triton
Inference Server with the
NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite.
Serve a Model in 3 Easy Steps
# Step 1: Create the example model repository
git clone -b r24.06 https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server.git
cd server/docs/examples
./fetch_models.sh

# Step 2: Launch triton from the NGC Triton container
docker run --gpus=1 --rm --net=host -v ${PWD}/model_repository:/models nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:24.06-py3 tritonserver --model-repository=/models

# Step 3: Sending an Inference Request
# In a separate console, launch the image_client example from the NGC Triton SDK container
docker run -it --rm --net=host nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:24.06-py3-sdk
/workspace/install/bin/image_client -m densenet_onnx -c 3 -s INCEPTION /workspace/images/mug.jpg

# Inference should return the following
Image '/workspace/images/mug.jpg':
    15.346230 (504) = COFFEE MUG
    13.224326 (968) = CUP
    10.422965 (505) = COFFEEPOT
Please read the QuickStart guide for additional information
regarding this example. The quickstart guide also contains an example of how to launch Triton on CPU-only systems. New to Triton and wondering where to get started? Watch the Getting Started video.
Examples and Tutorials
Check out NVIDIA LaunchPad
for free access to a set of hands-on labs with Triton Inference Server hosted on
NVIDIA infrastructure.
Specific end-to-end examples for popular models, such as ResNet, BERT, and DLRM
are located in the
NVIDIA Deep Learning Examples
page on GitHub. The
NVIDIA Developer Zone
contains additional documentation, presentations, and examples.
Documentation
Build and Deploy
The recommended way to build and use Triton Inference Server is with Docker
images.

Install Triton Inference Server with Docker containers (Recommended)
Install Triton Inference Server without Docker containers
Build a custom Triton Inference Server Docker container
Build Triton Inference Server from source
Build Triton Inference Server for Windows 10
Examples for deploying Triton Inference Server with Kubernetes and Helm on GCP,
AWS, and NVIDIA FleetCommand
Secure Deployment Considerations

Using Triton
Preparing Models for Triton Inference Server
The first step in using Triton to serve your models is to place one or
more models into a model repository. Depending on
the type of the model and on what Triton capabilities you want to enable for
the model, you may need to create a model
configuration for the model.

Add custom operations to Triton if needed by your model
Enable model pipelining with Model Ensemble
and Business Logic Scripting (BLS)
Optimize your models setting scheduling and batching
parameters and model instances.
Use the Model Analyzer tool
to help optimize your model configuration with profiling
Learn how to explicitly manage what models are available by loading and
unloading models

Configure and Use Triton Inference Server

Read the Quick Start Guide to run Triton Inference
Server on both GPU and CPU
Triton supports multiple execution engines, called
backends, including
TensorRT,
TensorFlow,
PyTorch,
ONNX,
OpenVINO,
Python, and more
Not all the above backends are supported on every platform supported by Triton.
Look at the
Backend-Platform Support Matrix
to learn which backends are supported on your target platform.
Learn how to optimize performance using the
Performance Analyzer
and
Model Analyzer
Learn how to manage loading and unloading models in
Triton
Send requests directly to Triton with the HTTP/REST JSON-based
or gRPC protocols

Client Support and Examples
A Triton client application sends inference and other requests to Triton. The
Python and C++ client libraries
provide APIs to simplify this communication.

Review client examples for C++,
Python,
and Java
Configure HTTP
and gRPC
client options
Send input data (e.g. a jpeg image) directly to Triton in the body of an HTTP
request without any additional metadata

Extend Triton
Triton Inference Server's architecture is specifically
designed for modularity and flexibility

Customize Triton Inference Server container for your use case
Create custom backends
in either C/C++
or Python
Create decoupled backends and models that can send
multiple responses for a request or not send any responses for a request
Use a Triton repository agent to add functionality
that operates when a model is loaded and unloaded, such as authentication,
decryption, or conversion
Deploy Triton on Jetson and JetPack
Use Triton on AWS
Inferentia

Contributing
Contributions to Triton Inference Server are more than welcome. To
contribute please review the contribution
guidelines. If you have a backend, client,
example or similar contribution that is not modifying the core of
Triton, then you should file a PR in the contrib
repo.
Reporting problems, asking questions
We appreciate any feedback, questions or bug reporting regarding this project.
When posting issues in GitHub,
follow the process outlined in the Stack Overflow document.
Ensure posted examples are:

minimal – use as little code as possible that still produces the
same problem
complete – provide all parts needed to reproduce the problem. Check
if you can strip external dependencies and still show the problem. The
less time we spend on reproducing problems the more time we have to
fix it
verifiable – test the code you're about to provide to make sure it
reproduces the problem. Remove all other problems that are not
related to your request/question.

For issues, please use the provided bug report and feature request templates.
For questions, we recommend posting in our community
GitHub Discussions.
For more information
Please refer to the NVIDIA Developer Triton page
for more information.
